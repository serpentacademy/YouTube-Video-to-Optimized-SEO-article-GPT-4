<h1>GPT-4 and OpenAI API Overview: Unlocking the Power of AI</h1>

<p>In this article, we will explore the main concepts of GPT-4 and OpenAI API, and learn how to make real requests. We will also discuss the top uses of GPT-4, including drafting marketing emails, creating Python code, developing conversational agents, and more.</p>

<h2>Top Uses of GPT-4</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Draft marketing emails:</strong> Create powerful and personalized email templates for your customers.</li>
  <li><strong>Create Python code:</strong> Develop powerful tools and solutions for companies of all sizes.</li>
  <li><strong>Conversational agents:</strong> Engage users with AI-powered chatbots in your applications and projects.</li>
  <li><strong>Give software a voice:</strong> Make robots speak intelligently and give context to their behavior in video games and applications.</li>
  <li><strong>Create tutors:</strong> Develop AI-powered tutors for learning science, arts, programming, and more.</li>
  <li><strong>Language translation:</strong> Translate your website or application into multiple languages without hiring translators.</li>
  <li><strong>Create characters for video games:</strong> Develop unpredictable stories and character simulations.</li>
  <li><strong>Create music:</strong> Generate melodies, soundtracks, and symphonies using AI.</li>
  <li><strong>SEO assistance:</strong> Improve descriptions, labels, grammar, and style for better search engine optimization.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Introduction to GPT-4</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>The actual king of natural language processing for content generation, semantic search, and classification. Imagine this semantic search. Imagine searching for something semantic about certain genes in 50 papers using chat. This is GPT-4. Amazing.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Prompts and Prompt Engineering</h2>
<p>Design good prompts or escalate prompt engineering for virtually any task, including content or code generation, summarization, expansion, conversation, creative writing, style transfer, and more. Key points include understanding user intent, crafting clear prompts, adding context, and testing and refining the queries.</p>

<h2>Tokens and Costs</h2>
<p>Tokens are the way the AI understands text. The cost for 1000 tokens is 0.03 USD for GPT-4, and the cost for 1000 tokens in GPT-3.5 Turbo is 0.002. GPT-4 is more powerful but also more expensive.</p>

<h2>API Introduction and Libraries</h2>
<p>You will need two actual libraries for working with OpenAI APIs: Python and Node.js. You can also use community libraries for other languages, but it is recommended to stick to the official libraries.</p>

<h3>API Key Authentication</h3>
<p>Keep your API key confidential and avoid sharing it with anyone or revealing it in any client-side code. For production requests, use your own backend server, which can securely access your API key from an environment variable or a key management service.</p>

<h2>Example: Math Tutor Using Chat GPT-4 API</h2>
<p>Here is a simple example of using the Chat GPT-4 API to create a math tutor. The example demonstrates how to call the API, set the model, temperature, max tokens, and pass messages with roles and content.</p>

<h2>Role Object and Content</h2>
<p>The role object has three values: system, user, and assistant. System is for adding system context, user for giving clear explanations of what you want, and assistant for providing examples of responses or real responses from previous API calls.</p>
